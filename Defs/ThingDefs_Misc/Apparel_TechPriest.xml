		<description>The personal equipment and wargear of a Tech-Priest varies greatly and can consist of anything from standard weaponry to more exotic pieces of Archaeotech. However typical wargear includes their Mechadendrites and an Omnissian Axe which acts as a badge of office. Tech-Priests of militant orders such as a Dominus are equipped with more radical weaponry such as Eradication Rays, Macrostubbers, Phosphor Serpenta, and Volkite Blasters. They are also typically protected by a Refractor Field.\n\nStandard Tech-Priest Enginseers are equipped with less exotic weapons, such as a Laspistol and Servo-arms.</description>

		<description>Skitarii War Plate is a type of armour of used by Adeptus Mechanicus Skitarii. These armoured plates are designed to be worn for several years at a time.\n\nSecreted under a superdermal layer of ceramite alloy are recombinant cells that harness moisture from the wearer and recycle it. This liquid is transmuted into a gelatinous unguent that coats the inside of the suit, preventing the slow abrasion of the wearer's body whilst affording a measure of protection from the harmful effects of their weaponry.</description> <!-- TODO: Edit Desc -->
