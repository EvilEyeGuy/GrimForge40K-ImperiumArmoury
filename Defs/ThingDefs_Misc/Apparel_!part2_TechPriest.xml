		<description>The Skitarii Ranger helmet consists of two parts: the helmet itself and the hood of the Ranger's robe. The faceplate of the helmet serves a dual purpose. It not only protects the wearer's vital organs but also functions as a transmission device for all the sensory information a Skitarii Ranger gathers during their mission. The Ranger's eyes are always open, as their eyelids are surgically removed so that the Magos in control wouldn't miss a single detail. Additionally, the Skitarii helmet is equipped with a built-in rebreather, a vital necessity in the toxic atmosphere of Mars and on numerous battlefields across the galaxy.</description>
