		<label>guard flak armor</label>
		<description>Flak armor is a light and relatively simple form of body armor used by the military forces of the Imperium of Man. It is relatively cheap and easy to produce on an average Imperial world. Usually flak armor consists of a skeleton, composed of flexible, lightweight metals. The skeleton is wrapped in several layers of ablative, shock-resistant materials and ballistic textiles. Once multiple layers of fabric are affixed to the skeleton, the armor is given its toughened outer shell. This combination of materials provides a decent degree of protection against most stub-weaponry and energy weapons, comparable to a lasgun.</description>

		<label>guard carapace armor</label>
		<description>Carapace armor is a significantly heavier variant of flak armor most commonly issued to stormtroopers and commissars. In some rare cases, it can be worn by Planetary Defense Force troops. Carapace armor has noticeably better protective capabilities; however, it comes with the caveat of higher mass and no power assistance, thus tiring out the wearer much faster, compared to flak or power armor. The largest issue with the mass-scale production of carapace armor is its cost.</description>

		<description>A standard-issue carapace helmet commonly used by Astra Militarum stormtroopers and Tempestus Scions across the entire galaxy. This type of protective gear utilizes ceramite plates molded into the standard flak helmet design, resulting in increased protective capabilities at the expense of greater weight and production costs.
