		<description>The Skitarii are also known as Tech-Guard to outsiders. Their wargear is somewhat unique compared to other servants of the Imperium of Mankind. The innermost layer of the Skitarii ranger war plate is coated with recombinant cells that collect the moisture from the wearer's skin and form an extra layer of defense. This layer is composed of thick gelatinous material, that both protects the user's body from the abrasion caused by ceramite armor plates and shields the wearer from the radiation emitted by the more dangerous weapons.\n\nSkitarii Rangers in particular are best known for their hunter-killer role due to their legendary stamina. They are capable of tracking and hunting their foe for weeks without rest or interruption.</description>

		<label>Skitarii ranger helmet</label>
		<description>The Skitarii Ranger helmet consists of two parts: the helmet itself and the hood of the Ranger's robe. The faceplate of the helmet serves a dual purpose. It not only protects the wearer's vital organs but also functions as a transmission device for all the sensory information a Skitarii Ranger gathers during their mission. The Ranger's eyes are always open, as their eyelids are surgically removed so that the Magos in control wouldn't miss a single detail. Additionally, the Skitarii helmet is equipped with a built-in rebreather, a vital necessity in the toxic atmosphere of Mars and on numerous battlefields across the galaxy.</description>

		<description>Skitarii vanguard helmets are designed to provide a substantial degree of defense against most of types of damage, as well as shield its wearer from the deadly radiation emitted by the weapons most commonly used by the Skitarii Vanguard. However, with prolonged exposure to extreme levels of radiation, even this kind of protection does not suffice. And on the rare occasions when these warriors remove their helmets, the sight of their missing teeth and hairless, sore-pocked skin tells the terrible truth. It is a price they are willing to pay, for their devotion to the Machine God is absolute.</description>

		<description>Skitarii vanguard helmets are designed to provide a substantial degree of defense against most of types of damage, as well as shield its wearer from the deadly radiation emitted by the weapons most commonly used by the Skitarii Vanguard. However, with prolonged exposure to extreme levels of radiation, even this kind of protection does not suffice. And on the rare occasions when these warriors remove their helmets, the sight of their missing teeth and hairless, sore-pocked skin tells the terrible truth. It is a price they are willing to pay, for their devotion to the Machine God is absolute.\n\nThis particular helmet has a distinctive feature: a golden crest adorning its top, signifying the wearer's status as an 'Alpha' or a Skitarii Vanguard Overseer — a cyborg, who has proven worthy of a degree of independence and autonomy on the battlefield, filling the role of an officer.</description>
